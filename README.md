Script to wrap a script call. Meant to source common functionality in a single script to save effort in the actual called script. For now just providing logger functionality and some network functions (see the ./tools/tools.sh).

See the scripts/test/test.sh and scripts/test/test.conf on how to use the logging functionality.

Call 
```bash
./run.sh ./scripts/test/test.conf
```

to run the test script.


This a very first draft, quick and dirty - use on your own risk
