First draft of the run.sh scripts

Wraps common functionality scripts might use in a basic script.

Wrote a lot of scripts the last days and found that a lot of the funtionality like logging/checking for resources are taking a lot of time to write over and over again for each script. this is a first draft of a centralized resource checking script that checks pre-script-call if the resources needed are present.

do not use. work in progress...
